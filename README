-----

This library exposes just one class: "Value". Ben::Value objects are 
used to hold single values or recursive structures. It can store 
different types: Null, integer, string, boolean, a list of Values, or a 
dictionary (key-value pairs). The object has interface loading the 
contents from Bencoded string and serializing the content to Bencode. 
The objects can be also compared and copied.

Bencode is defined here: http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html

Why Bencode?

While less efficient than a pure binary encoding, bencoding is simple 
and (because numbers are encoded in decimal notation) is unaffected by 
endianness, which is important for a cross-platform application like 
BitTorrent. It is also fairly flexible, as long as applications ignore 
unexpected dictionary keys, so that new ones can be added without 
creating incompatibilities. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode)
