Why bencode?

While less efficient than a pure binary encoding, bencoding is simple 
and (because numbers are encoded in decimal notation) is unaffected by 
endianness, which is important for a cross-platform application like 
BitTorrent. It is also fairly flexible, as long as applications ignore 
unexpected dictionary keys, so that new ones can be added without 
creating incompatibilities. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode)
